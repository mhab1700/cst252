		<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>Some challenges we faced was problem-solving how exactly to go about fading out an element
				when it hit the edge of the page, and transcribing that into a viable plan. I think Psuedocode definetly helps rather
			than just jumping right into the code to organize your thoughts, and create a successful function.</p>

		<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p>Some problems that we faced was finding good ways to describe what we wanted to happen in these functions with short statements.
			We realized that it may be a good plan to have our function work with a mix of CSS, and JS. Fading in with CSS, and fading out with a
		JS scroll function.</p>
	</div>
	<div class=results>
		<h1>Results</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>// define element class .js-scroll, and .js-scrolled</li>
			<li>// make .js-scroll hide whenever .js-scrolled is applied to it</li>
			<li>// target class .js-scroll</li>
			<li>// detect when element is in view by finding the distance of the element from the top of the page</li>
			<li>// add the scrolled class to the .js-scroll element with for each</li>
			<li>// pass into a scroll event listener</li>
