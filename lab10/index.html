		<h2> Challenge</h2>
			<p>For lab 10 we are taskes with creating an event that takes our input, and when clicking on the button outputs what we typed into the h1 tag
			replacing our h1 with a sorted version of whatever was typed into the input box. </p>
<br>
		<h2> Problems</h2>
			<p>The hardest part of the lab was organizing the sorting functions so that it would produce an anagram.</p>
<br>
		<h2> Results</h2>
			<p>Now we have a working event to change the h1 tag with input value, and a click of a button..</p>
Name: <input type=text id=input>
			</p>
<button id="my-button">Push Here</button>
<div id= "output">
</div>
