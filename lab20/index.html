		<h1>Lab 20: JSON and APIs</h1>
<br>
		<h2 > Challenge</h2>
			<p> For Lab 20 we had to create an AJAX function that would request a comic called xkcd if it succeeds it loads up the monthtly
			comic for our viewing pleasure.  </p>
<br>
		<h2> Problems</h2>
			<p>For a while could not get the image to render on the page, but with some troubleshooting, and studying Wes's lab we were able
			to get it working smoothly.</p>
<br>
		<h2> Results</h2>
			<p>Now we have a montly comic that allows us to view previous months comics as well on our HTML page for lab 20. </p>
