		<h1>Lab 16 - Javascript Classes and Objects</h1>
<br>
		<h2 > Challenge</h2>
			<p> For Lab 16 we created a vehicle object that uses key-value pairs to output different variables we put in. This then is outputted through
			JQuery onto the HTML Page in an organized way with the method .info(). </p>
<br>
		<h2> Problems</h2>
			<p>Some problems we ran into was forgetting to add the p tags in the output div, and also just a few little typos that we were
			able to pick up on using the console, and debugging strategies.</p>
<br>
		<h2> Results</h2>
			<p>Now we have a function that outputs our Javascript objects, and attributes in an orderly way onto the HTML </p>
