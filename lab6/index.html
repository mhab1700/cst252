	 <h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
	 <p>Experimenting with laying out arrays, and objects, and having them outputted.</p>
	 <h1>Challenges</h1>
	 	<p>There were challenges along the way, but overall it went good. We faced difficulties like outputting, and also just applying what we
		have learned about the use of Arrays, and Objects. Overall it was a great learn by doing experience, and being hands on with Arrays, and Objects really
	helped us tackle the concept, and the uses for these features.</p>
	 <h1>Results</h1>
	 	<p>Are results gave us an output of data using a combination of Arrays, and Objects that can now be changed using other JavaScript functions like .push</p>
