	<h1> Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
<br>
		<h2> Challenge</h2>
			<p>For this lab we worked on callbacks, and some anonymous functions that are useful for calculations as they only really use parameters.
			We created a couple examples one adding 5 to the array, and another that gives the squarteroot of each number in the array.
		After that we printed out to the HTML. </p>
<br>
		<h2> Problems</h2>
			<p>When using anonymous functions it can get confusing without proper psuedocode, but after getting organized it started to flow better,
			and we got it to work. Also outputting to the HTML was confusing, and after trial, and error, and some research on Google turns output
		we had to add defer to the script link at the top to get it to print.</p>
<br>
		<h2> Results</h2>
			<p>Now we have a page that shows a working anonymous function that prints the array, adding 5 to the numbers in the array,
				 and the squareroot of numbers in the array</p>
