		<h1> Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
<br>
		<h2> Challenge</h2>
			<p>In this lab we were tasked with writing a function in JavaScript to take a user input, and output it into the HTML.
			To do this we had to make a sorted array. Starting with a string we convert this to an array with .split, and sort that array with .sort.
		After that we brought it back to the string with .join. </p>
<br>
		<h2> Problems</h2>
			<p>It can be confusing going back and forth between strings, and arrays, but I think it is starting to stick on which is used for which, and how to
			go back, and forth between each.</p>
<br>
		<h2> Results</h2>
			<p>Are results gave us a simple webpage that has the user input there name, and prints it onto the HTML </p>

<div>
		<h2>Script Output</h2>
		<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
</div>
