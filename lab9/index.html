	<h1> Lab 9 - JavaScript For The Web</h1>
<br>
		<h2> Challenge</h2>
			<p>For lab 9 we took a bit of JavaScipt that was styled with Javascript CSS atrributes,
				 and outputed it to the HTML page via Elements, InnerHTML, and AppendChild. In our case we had two different buttons to showcase. </p>
<br>
		<h2> Problems</h2>
			<p>The only problem we ran into is that we could not change the size of the buttons via JavaSript.
				It might just be a small error with grammar that caused this.</p>
<br>
		<h2> Results</h2>
			<p>Now we have an HTML page with some cool looking buttons that are appended at the bottom of the page from JavaScript, and outputted through the
			outpu div tag in HTML.</p>


<div id= "output">
