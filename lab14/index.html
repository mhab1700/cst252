		<h1>Lab 14 - Loops</h1>
<br>
		<h2 > Challenge</h2>
			<p>Our main challenge Was to create a loop that would loop from 1 to 200. With this loop we had to create a function for the numbers 3, 5, and 7
			which should print out either Fuzz! Buzz! or Boom! or even a combination based on the numbers being true multiples of
		either 3, 5, or 7. If there is a remainder when dividing one of these numbers the respective number would get no attribute.</p>
<br>
		<h2> Problems</h2>
			<p>We worked through the reframing of how the loop was setup in class which was a great problem solving experience, and saw that
			 your site used some input data, and returned the results with that, couldn't quite wrap our heads around that,
			  but we got the basics of the lab there
		 no problem.</p>
<br>
		<h2> Results</h2>
			<p>Now we have a loop from 1 to 200 outputted on our HTML with the attributes Fizz, Buzz, and Boom applied to the numbers
			that deserved it based on how each number multiplied in.</p>
