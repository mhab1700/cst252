		<h1>Lab 13 - Conditionals</h1>
<br>
		<h2 > Challenge</h2>
			<p>Our main challenge from this lab was trying to get the output to work as well  but since one of us has experience with if statements it made it a bit easier </p>
<br>
		<h2> Problems</h2>
			<p>Our biggest problem was not getting the java to print out the output into the main page. then we saw it was a missing element</p>
<br>
		<h2> Results</h2>
			<p>We ended up getting it done a lot quicker than expected and outside the small problem which we found quickly we managed to get it working right!</p>
